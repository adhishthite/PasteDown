# App Flow Document

## Introduction

The Markdown PasteBin is a simple web application built to allow anyone to paste, share, and view Markdown content through a unique URL. When a user visits the app, they are greeted with a clean and minimal interface that focuses solely on the Markdown editor and live preview. The main goal is to provide a distraction-free environment for creating Markdown, rendering it beautifully in real time, and sharing that content without any need for registration. The application also comes with safeguards like auto-deletion of content after three days and rate limiting to maintain performance and prevent abuse.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Unlike many applications, there is no traditional sign-up or login process since the service does not require user accounts. Users simply visit the landing page directly and start using the Markdown editor. There is no need to register or provide any personal information. The simplicity of accessing the app is a key highlight: users can quickly begin writing and editing their Markdown without barriers, making the service accessible to anyone who needs to share formatted text online.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon visiting the web application, users are immediately presented with a landing page that doubles as the main interface for creating and previewing content. The layout is clean and focuses on the Markdown textarea and a live preview pane that updates as the user types. This is the default view and the only primary interface in the application. Although there is no user dashboard in a conventional sense with multiple sections, the page itself is designed to clearly separate the editing area from the rendered Markdown preview. Any navigation beyond the creation process is minimal and is solely geared toward sharing and viewing pastes via the unique URL once a paste is submitted.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user lands on the app, they immediately find a large text area that encourages direct input of Markdown content. As the user begins typing, a live preview updates in real time to show how the Markdown will be rendered. This gives immediate feedback and ensures there is no guesswork involved regarding formatting. Users can freely edit their content until they are completely satisfied with the output. Once they decide to finalize the content, they click the clearly labeled Submit button. Once the Submit action is triggered, the application locks the paste to prevent any further modifications and generates a unique short identifier using a secure algorithm. This identifier is incorporated into a shareable URL which is then prominently displayed on screen. At this point, users are able to copy and share the link easily. If anyone visits this URL, they are presented with a read-only view of the Markdown content. The final rendered paste is shown in a clutter-free format optimized for readability on both desktop and mobile devices. The journey from editing to submission and then to the viewing of the paste is seamless, ensuring that every step is clear and connected for the user.

## Settings and Account Management

This application is designed with simplicity in mind and does not involve traditional user settings or account management. There is no need for personal information updates, notification configurations, or billing settings since the Markdown PasteBin is a free and open service. The only adjustments a user can make are within the Markdown editor itself before finalizing the content. After the paste is submitted, there are no further configuration options available. The absence of these pages contributes to a minimalist experience that keeps users focused on content creation and sharing.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

When a user or a visitor attempts to access a paste using a URL that is either incorrect or points to an expired paste, the application redirects them to a custom error page. This page clearly explains that the paste is invalid or has expired, all while maintaining the same aesthetic as the rest of the application. In the case of invalid data submission or if the request exceeds the permitted rate (with each IP limited to five requests per hour), the system responds with appropriate error messages. These error messages are designed to be helpful and guide the user back into normal usage. The error handling is consistent across the app, ensuring that even when interruptions occur, the user experience remains smooth and understandable.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall flow of the Markdown PasteBin is straightforward and efficient. Users arrive at the application without any barriers such as signing in, immediately get into a distraction-free Markdown editing environment, and enjoy a live preview of their content. Once they are happy with their paste, they submit it to receive a unique URL. This URL is then used to view the paste in a read-only format, with the system ensuring that the content is automatically removed after three days. Error scenarios, such as invalid or expired links, are handled with custom error pages that keep the experience consistent and informative. The journey, from landing on the app through creating and sharing Markdown content, is designed to be as simple and user-friendly as possible while still offering robust functionality that can scale to include additional features in future phases.
